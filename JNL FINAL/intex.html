<h1> The rise of Physical Therapy </h1>
<h2> Behind one of the Fastest Growing Industries </h2>
<p><strong> By Chase Avery </strong></p>
<p>

<p>
Physical therapy is a healthcare profession that involves the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of physical impairments, disabilities, and pain. It is a constantly evolving field that has seen tremendous growth in recent years especially during COVID. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment of physical therapists is predicted to grow 21% between 2020 and 2030.  </p>
<p>
The growth of physical therapy is due to multiple factors, aging population and advances in medical technology are two of the biggest reasons. While and increased awareness of the benefits of physical therapy is another. Furthermore, medical technology has made significant strides in recent years, allowing for more accurate diagnoses and more effective treatment options. This has increased the demand for physical therapists who are trained to work with these new technologies. Taylor Witzki is a facilities manager and physical therapist at the Ravenswood Athletico in Chicago. She said that in her practice she uses a software called Med-Bridge that allows her to connect with clients to make at home exercises for them to do. She said “Med-Bridge has helped me send at home exercises to many of my clients.”</p>

<p> Another important factor contributing to the growth of physical therapy is the increased awareness of its benefits. It is now being used as more of a first-line treatment to help with many injuries. Witzki said that it is “Much easier to be able to go to PT now than it used to be because you don’t always need a note from a doctor to get therapy done.” </p>

<p> The growth of physical therapy has also been facilitated by advances in education and training. Physical therapists are now required to have a doctoral degree, which provides them with advanced training in anatomy, physiology, and other related subjects. More people nowadays are getting a graduate degree after college. According to the National Center for Education Statisics “Between 2009–10 and 2019–20, the total number of master’s degrees conferred increased by 22 percent, from 693,300 to 843,400 degrees”. </p>

<p> The growth of physical therapy has also been driven by changes in healthcare policy. In recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on preventative care, and physical therapy is a key component of this approach. By helping patients to manage their conditions and prevent further injury, physical therapy can help to reduce healthcare costs and improve overall patient outcomes. As a result, many insurance companies now cover physical therapy services, making it more accessible to a wider range of patients. When I talked with Witzki she said, “It’s been a lot easier for physical therapy companies like Athletico to go through insurance though smaller businesses can still have trouble with insurances”.  </p>

<p> Despite its growth, physical therapy still faces several challenges. One of the biggest challenges is the shortage of physical therapists in many areas. This is due in part to the rigorous education and training requirement. According to College Tuition Compare, the average cost for an undergraduate program is around $32,000 while a graduate program is around $24,000. </p>

<p> In conclusion, the growth of physical therapy has seen a tremendous uptick during the pandemic as well as in general over the last ten years. New technology, an easier system of insurance and more people using physical therapy as a first-line treatment are all reasons why it has gained such popularity. When I interviewed Witzki it also seemed like a very fun profession that gives workers a chance to help people every day. Witzki said “I love my job. I used to work a lot of customer health service jobs. In which there weren’t a lot of growth opportunities. I was teaching yoga a lot of spin classes… there was no paid time off and no health benefits which was a huge reason why I wanted to go into PT. I also love that I get to be able to help people everyday”. </p>
